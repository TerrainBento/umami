Development Practices
=====================

Contribution Guidelines

User contributions are welcome pull requests on a development branch. Umami strives for a meaningful 100% code coverage, adherence to [PEP8](), low lint levels using [Flake8](), and [Black style](). Many of these standards are enforced by continuous integration tests and the development team will help you bring contributions into compliance. Please see the [Development Practices]() page for more information.
