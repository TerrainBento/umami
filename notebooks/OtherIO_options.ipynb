    "# Part 3: Other options for input\n",
    "\n",
    "Umami is a package for calculating metrics for use with for Earth surface dynamics models. This notebook is the final notebook in a three-part introduction to using umami.\n",
    "\n",
    "Umami was designed to work well with the [terrainbento](https://terrainbento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model package, as well as other models built using the [Landlab Toolkit](https://github.com/landlab/landlab). However, umami can be used with models built with other modeling tools and data in a variety of formats. This notebook is meant to demonstrate this capability. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to use other input options along with umami. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we will use square gridded terrain stored in [ESRI ASCII](http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/java/GP_ToolRef/spatial_analyst_tools/esri_ascii_raster_format.htm) format. We will read this in as a numpy array. We will also interpolate it to an irregular grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have comments or questions about the notebooks, the best place to get help is through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TerrainBento/umami/issues).\n",

    "\n",
